============== INFO =============

This CAFFE Model runs over the architecture of [1] with additional modification

     1. Multiscale approach of 3 parallel networks as described in [2]
     2. Additional cost funtions
     3. Considers class-countours (class-boundaries) in cummulative architecture

     IMPORTANT : 
     	
	This code to work requires the installation of the original SegNEt Caffe repository. 
	This is quite outdated but all dependecies are available. Instructions for this 
	repocitory can be found at:
