This url containlinks to the weights of the trained caffe-models over the ISPRS-Postdam benchmark
The weights were initialized with the following model

    - Class-Boundaries part of the model	----> DSD HED model  [1]

    - Annotation part of the network 		----> Long john FCN-Pascal [2]
 

TODO: 
      * Upload caffemodel weights to a different sever for sharing
